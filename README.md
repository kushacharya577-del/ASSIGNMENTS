# 📌 ASSIGNMENT – 1  
## Business Problem Report  
### Domain: Banking & Finance  
### Problem: Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

---

## 🔹 1. Introduction

The Banking and Financial Services sector handles millions of digital transactions daily. With rapid growth in online payments, credit card fraud has become a major concern.

Fraudulent transactions cause:
- Financial losses  
- Customer dissatisfaction  
- Reputation damage  

This assignment addresses fraud detection using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques.

---

## 🔹 2. Problem Statement

Traditional rule-based systems:
- Fail to detect new fraud patterns  
- Generate high false positives  

The business requires an intelligent system that can:

- Detect fraud instantly  
- Reduce false positives  
- Minimize financial losses  
- Improve customer trust  

---

## 🔹 3. Machine Learning Perspective

- **Type:** Supervised Learning  
- **Category:** Binary Classification  

Output:
- `0 → Genuine Transaction`
- `1 → Fraudulent Transaction`

---

## 🔹 4. Data Requirements

### Input Features:
- Transaction amount  
- Transaction time  
- Merchant category  
- Customer location  
- Device information  
- Number of recent transactions  
- Account balance  

### Target Variable:
- Fraud Label (Yes/No)

---

## 🔹 5. Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values  
- Remove duplicates  
- Normalize transaction amount  
- Encode categorical features  
- Handle class imbalance  

### Imbalance Handling:
- SMOTE  
- Undersampling  
- Class weight balancing  

---

## 🔹 6. Feature Engineering

- Average daily transaction amount  
- Transaction frequency  
- Geographic transaction distance  
- Spending pattern analysis  

---

## 🔹 7. Model Selection

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)  
- Neural Networks  

Ensemble models are preferred for higher performance.

---

## 🔹 8. Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy alone is not sufficient.

Important metrics:
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- ROC-AUC  

High Recall is critical in fraud detection.

---

## 🔹 9. Expected Business Impact

- Reduced fraud losses  
- Increased customer trust  
- Real-time fraud monitoring  
- Improved financial security  

---

## 🔹 10. Conclusion

Machine learning enables proactive fraud detection, reduces financial risk, and strengthens banking security systems.

# 📌 ASSIGNMENT – 2  
## Normal Distribution in Employee Salaries  

---

## 🔹 1. Introduction

Employee salaries in medium to large organizations often follow a **Normal Distribution**.

A normal distribution:
- Is symmetric and bell-shaped  
- Has Mean = Median = Mode  
- Most values cluster around the average  

---

## 🔹 2. Assumed Parameters

- **Mean (μ) = ₹50,000**
- **Standard Deviation (σ) = ₹10,000**

---

## 🔹 3. Graph Explanation

- **X-axis → Salary (₹)**
- **Y-axis → Number of Employees**
- Center = ₹50,000
- Spread = ₹10,000

Most employees earn near the average salary.

---

## 🔹 4. Empirical Rule (68–95–99.7 Rule)

### μ ± 1σ
- ₹40,000 – ₹60,000  
- Covers 68% of employees  

### μ ± 2σ
- ₹30,000 – ₹70,000  
- Covers 95% of employees  

### μ ± 3σ
- ₹20,000 – ₹80,000  
- Covers 99.7% of employees  

---

## 🔹 5. Tabular Representation

| Range | Salary (₹) | Percentage |
|--------|------------|------------|
| μ ± 1σ | 40,000–60,000 | 68% |
| μ ± 2σ | 30,000–70,000 | 95% |
| μ ± 3σ | 20,000–80,000 | 99.7% |

---

## 🔹 6. Applications in Business

- Fair compensation planning  
- Pay gap identification  
- Budget forecasting  
- Workforce analysis  
- Performance-based increments  

---

## 🔹 Conclusion

Employee salary distribution follows a normal curve where most values lie near the mean. The Empirical Rule helps understand salary spread and supports strategic decision-making.
